## Coding guidelines

- Two spaces indentation.
- CamelCase for classes.
- camelCase for methods & variables.
- Max line length at 80 chars.

- Classes can be no longer than 100 LOC.
- Methods can be no longer than 5 LOC.
- Pass no more than 4 parameters/hash keys into a method.

- Composition over Inheritance.
- Comments are a code smell.
- Routes can instantiate only one object.
- Require other classes with 'use' at the beginning of the class file.
- Do not specify 'public' if method is public, it's implicit.
- Always use guard clauses.

- Do not commit to master.
- Open a short-living feature branch.
- Open a pull request.
- Wait for confirmation before merging to master.

- Keep the GitHub open issues count at less than 10.
- Discuss development on public Slack chats.
- Organize features on Trello.
- Open a small github issue only when it has been discussed.
- GitHub is not a place for features discussion.
