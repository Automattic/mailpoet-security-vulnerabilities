## Coding guidelines

- Two spaces indentation.
- CamelCase for classes.
- camelCase for methods & variables.
- Max line length at 80 chars.
- Composition over Inheritance.
- Classes can be no longer than 100 LOC.
- Methods can be no longer than 5 LOC.
- Pass no more than 4 parameters/hash keys into a method.
- Routes can instantiate only one object.
- Require other classes with 'use' at the beginning of the class file.
- Do not specify 'public' if method is public, it's implicit.
